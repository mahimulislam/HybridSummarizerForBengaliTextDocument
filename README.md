# HybridSummarizerForBengaliTextDocument

This is our ongoing thesis topic.  We have tried to explore a new method for the generation of summary from Bengali documents. We had to consider all the major topics present in the document. If the summary contains sentences from all the major topics present in the document, that has a better
chance of giving better perspective of the document. Our summary generation approach is
extractive. We have implemented 3 different models:
1.Keyword Extraction Model,
2.Sentiment Based Model,
3.Hybrid Model (which involves both)
We have found an average Rouge Score of 60% using our hybrid model.
