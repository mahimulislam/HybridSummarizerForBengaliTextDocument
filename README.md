# HybridTextSummarizerForBanglaDocuments

This is our Bachelor's thesis.  We have tried to explore a new method for the generation of summary from Bengali documents. We had to consider all the major sentences present in the document. If the summary contains sentences from all the major topics present in the document, that has a better
chance of giving better perspective of the document. Our summary generation approach is
extractive. We have implemented 3 different models:
1.Keyword Extraction Model,
2.Sentiment Based Model,
3.Text Ranking Based Model,
4.Hybrid Model (which involves all of them)
We tried to compare our model with existing models in these 2 ways :
1.Using the dataset from BNLPC on which the existing model worked and generating the summary by our system.
2.Using our dataset in an web based system, comparing the generated output with gold/benchmark summary .

On both cases,our system performed better in terms of f-measure.

Please check our presentation to get the overview of what we did.
And the soft copy of our book is also available.
